            <h1>Easy VEO Create</h1>
            <p>This program provides a simple method of creating structured VERS
                V3 VEOs.</p>
            <p>To create a VEO, a user creates a directory in the file system
                containing the VEO content as they wish it to be arranged in the
                VEO. The directory can contain subdirectories and these are
                converted into a structured VEO. The metadata to be included in
                the VEO is represented by text files in the directory whose
                names start with 'VERS-MD-'</p>

            <h2>Set-up pane</h2>
            <p>The main controls are located on the 'General' tab of this pane.
                The controls are as follows:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Source directory</b> This specifies a directory which
                    contains the information to create the VEOs. The directory
                    contains one or more subdirectories. Each subdirectory will
                    generate one VEO. The 'Browse' button on the right is used
                    to browse to the directory. This must be specified.</li>
		<li><b>Output directory</b> This specifies the directory
                    where the VEOs are to be created. The 'Browse' button on
                    the right can be used to select a new directory. This
                    must be specified.</li>
                <li><b>PFX file</b> This specifies the PFX file used to sign the
                    VEOs. The 'Browse' button on the right can be used to select
                    the PFX file. This is optional, but if it is not
                    specified the VEOs will not be signed.</li>
                <li><b>PFX password</b> This is the password for the PFX file.
                    This field must be entered if a PFX file is specified.</li>
                <li><b>Creation description</b> This is file that contains a
                    text description of the creation of the VEOs. It is
                    intended to be used to provide archival or record keeping
                    information about the records. This field is optional.</li>
                <li><b>Template directory</b> This field specifies the directory
                    that contains the templates used to construct the VEO.
                    Normally, a standard template directory should be used. If
                    necessary, the 'Browse' button on the right can be used to
                    select a new directory.</li>
                <li><b>Create VEOs</b> button. This button starts the creation
                    of the VEOs once the necessary information has been
                    entered. Initially, this button is greyed out and is
                    inactive. It will only become active when the source
                    directory and output directory have been entered. If
                    a PFX file has been entered, a PFX password must also be
                    entered.</li>
		</ul>
            <h2>Saving and loading jobs</h2>
            <p>To save time in entering the data required to create VEOs, it
                is possible to save the values in all the interface fields and
                reload them subsequently.</p>
            <p>To save the current state, select the 'File' menu and the 'Save
                Job'. You will be prompted for the file in which to save the
                current job.</p>
            <p>To reload a job, select the 'File' menu and the 'Load Job'
                option. You will be prompted for the file that contains the job
                to be loaded.</p>
            <p>Once a job has been loaded, any of the fields can be changed as
                required.</p>
            <h2>Other control options</h2>
            <p>The 'Exclusions' and 'Advanced' panes contain a number of
                advanced options that may be used to provide more control over
                the VEO creation process.</p>
            <h3>Exclusions Pane</h3>
            <p>This pane has two areas that allow files or directories to be
                excluded from the VEOs. These options are useful if the VEO
                contents already exist and may contain files that it is not
                desired to put in the VEO.</p>
            <p>The top area, 'Subfolders to exclude from harvest', can contain a
                list of directories that are not to be included in the VEO, one
                per line. 'Browse' and 'Delete' buttons are provided to add and
                delete entries in this area.</p>
            <p>The bottom area, 'File name patterns to exclude from harvest',
                allows the exclusion of particular files, one pattern per line.
                Patterns are expressed using a regular expression. For example,
                the pattern '*.tmp' will exclude any files with the file
                extension '.tmp'.</p>
            <h3>Advanced pane</h3>
            <p>This pane is used to control advanced functionality; in
                particular the level of logging and the hash algorithm to be
		used.</p>
